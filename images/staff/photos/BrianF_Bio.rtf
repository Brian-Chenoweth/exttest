\f0\fs24 \cf0 Brian joined the IGEE marketing team in fall of 2015 to develop videos and manage the social media accounts for the departments. With a dedicated team of student interns dubbed \'93The Action Team,\'94 Brian has produced over 100 promotional videos since starting- and the production schedule shows no sign of slowing. \

Brian received a BA in Film and Electronic Arts from Cal State Long Beach and worked in various film and TV productions for several years in Los Angeles. In this time the self-professed movie nerd honed his skills at Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon while filling his head with an unlimited number of movie quotes and song lyrics. Brian is happy to be putting his years of production experience to use at Cal Poly. Or as his silver screen hero would say, \'93The Dude abides.\'94}
